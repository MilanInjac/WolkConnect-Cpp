<div class="textblock"><p>WolkConnect libraries are used to enable a device's communication with <a href="https://demo.wolkabout.com/#/login">WolkAbout IoT Platform</a>.</p>
<p>Using WolkConnect libraries in the software or firmware of a device will drastically decrease the time to market for developers or anyone wanting to integrate their own product with WolkAbout IoT Platform.</p>
<p>WolkConnect libraries are open-source and released under the Apache Licence 2.0.</p>
<p>WolkConnect libraries are intended to be used on IP enabled devices. The available WolkConnect libraries (implemented in the following programming languages <a href="https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-C">C</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-Cpp">C++</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-Java-">Java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-Python">Python</a>) are platform independent for OS based devices, with a special note that the WolkConnect-C library is suitable to be adapted for use on non-OS devices as WolkConnect libraries have a small memory footprint.</p>
<p>Features of WolkAbout IoT Platform that have been incorporated into WolkConnect libraries will be disambiguated with information on how to perform these features on devices by using WolkConnect's API. </p><hr/>
 <h1>Conception</h1>
<hr/>
<p>The intention of the WolkConnect library is to be used as a dependency in other firmwares or softwares that have their own existing business logic. WolkConnect library is not by any means a single service to control the device, it is a library intended to handle all specific communication with WolkAbout IoT Platform.</p>
<p>Using WolkConnect library requires minimal knowledge of WolkAbout IoT Platform, no knowledge of the internal mechanisms and protocols of WolkAbout IoT Platform is necessary. The user only utilises APIs provided by WolkConnect library in the User Application Layer, thereby reducing time-to-market required.</p>
<p>The architecture of software/firmware where WolkConnect library is meant to be used is presented on <em>Fig.1.1</em>. The gray section of <em>Fig.1.1</em> represents the developer's software/firmware.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="/home/srdjanstankovic/git/WolkConnect-C/doc/Fig11.png"  alt="Fig.1.1 WolkConnect library represented in general software/firmware architecture." title="Fig.1.1 WolkConnect library represented in general software/firmware architecture."/>
</div>
 <center> <em>Fig.1.1 WolkConnect library represented in general software/firmware architecture.</em> </center><p>The gray section between User Application Layer and Hardware Abstraction Layer represents the user's libraries and drivers that are required for his project. Providing WolkConnect library with IP connectivity from the Hardware Abstraction Layer is expected from the user.</p>
<p>WolkConnect library is separated into layers as shown on <em>Fig.1.2</em></p>
<div class="image">
<img src="/home/srdjanstankovic/git/WolkConnect-C/doc/Fig12.png"  alt="Fig.1.2 WolkConnect library layer&apos;s" title="Fig.1.2 WolkConnect library layer&apos;s"/>
</div>
 <center> <em>Fig.1.2 WolkConnect library layer's</em> </center><p>WolkConnect libraries use IP connectivity provided by the OS, but on devices where this not available it is the user's responsibility to provide implementations for opening a socket and send/receive methods to the socket.</p>
<p>Communication between WolkConnect library and WolkAbout IoT Platform is achieved through the use of the <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT messaging protocol</a>. WolkConnect libraries have a common dependency, an implementation of an MQTT client that will exchange data with an MQTT server that is part of WolkAbout IoT Platform. The communication between WolkConnect library and WolkAbout IoT Platform is made secure with the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).</p>
<p>Another common dependency for WolkConnect libraries is a JSON library that is used for parsing data that is exchanged with WolkAbout IoT Platform. This data is formatted using a custom JSON based protocol defined by WolkAbout IoT Platform.</p>
<p>The high level API represents what is available to the developer that is using WolkConnect library. APIs follow the naming convention of the programming language they were written in. Consult a specific WolkConnect library's documentation for more information.</p>
<p>The API is divided into two parts: data management and device management. Device data is independent from device management on WolkAbout IoT Platform and therefore it has a separe API. Device management is responsible for device health and this in turn increases the device's lifespan.</p>
<p>The API has the following functionalities that will be explained in the remainder of this document:</p><ul>
<li><a href="#connect-and-disconnect">Connect &amp; Disconnect</a></li>
<li><a href="#sensor-readings">Sensor readings</a></li>
<li><a href="#alarms">Alarm states</a></li>
<li><a href="#actuators">Actuators</a></li>
<li><a href="#keep-alive-mechanism">Keep alive mechanism</a></li>
<li><a href="#configuration">Configuration</a></li>
<li><a href="#dfu">Device Software/Firmware Update</a></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
 <h1>API's functional description</h1>
<hr/>
<p> WolkConnect libraries separate a device's functionality through the API into two distinct parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Device data</b> - valuable data to be exchanged with WolkAbout IoT Platform</li>
<li><b>Device management</b> - allows monitoring and controlling the connected device in order to maintain data delivery integrity.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><a class="anchor" id="connect-and-disconnect"></a> </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Connect and disconnect</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every connection from a WolkConnect library to WolkAbout IoT Platform is authenticated with a device key and a device password. These credentials are created on WolkAbout IoT Platform when a device is created and are unique to that device. Only one active connection is allowed per device.</p>
<p>Attempting to create an additional connection with the same device credentials will terminate the previous connection. The connection is made secure by default in all WolkConnect libraries through the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Connecting without SSL is possible, refer to a specific WolkConnect library's documentation for more information.</p>
<p>A device can be connected to WolkAbout IoT Platform in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Always connected devices</b> - connect once and publish data when necessary. Actuations can only be used in this case, as sending actuations from WolkAbout IoT Platform are disabled when the device is offline.</li>
<li><b>Periodically connected device</b> - connect and publish data when needed. It is important to use disconnect here, as this is a valid device state on WolkAbout IoT Platform - controlled offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disconnecting will gracefully terminate the connection and the device will momentarily appear offline on WolkAbout IoT Platform. In cases of ungraceful disconnections, eg. due to a networking error, WolkAbout IoT Platform will be able to determine if the device is offline based on whether the device has send a message from its keep alive mechanism. After waiting for the keep alive mechanism timeout with no message, WolkAbout IoT Platform will declare the device offline.</p>
<h2>&gt; Device Data</h2>
<p>Real world devices can perform a wide variety of operations that result in meaningful data. These operations could be to conduct a measurement, monitor a certain condition or execute some form of command. The data resulting from these operations have been modeled into three distinct types of data on WolkAbout IoT Platform: sensors, alarms, and actuators.</p>
<p>Information needs to be distinguishable, so every piece of data sent from the device needs to have an identifier. This identifier is called a reference, and all references of a device on WolkAbout IoT Platform must be unique.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="sensor-readings"></a> </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Sensor readings</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sensor readings are stored on the device before explicitly being published to WolkAbout IoT Platform. If the exact time when the reading occured is meaningful information, it can be assigned to the reading as a UTC timestamp. If this timestamp is not provided, WolkAbout IoT Platform will assign the reading a timestamp when it has been received, treating the reading like it occured the moment it arrived.</p>
<p>Readings could be of a very high precision, and although this might not be fully displayed on the dashboard, the information is not lost and can be viewed on different parts of WolkAbout IoT Platform.</p>
<p>Sensors readings like GPS and accelerometers hold more than one single information and these types of readings are supported in WolkConnect libraries and on WolkAbout IoT Platform. This concept is called a multi-value reading.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="alarms"></a> </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Alarms</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alarms are derived from some data on the device and are used to indicate the state of a condition, eg. high-temperature alarm which is emerged as a result of exceeding a threshold value on the device. Alarm value can either be on or off.</p>
<p>Like sensor readings, alarm messages are stored on the device before being published to WolkAbout IoT Platform. Alarms can also have a UTC timestamp to denote when the alarm occurred, but if the timestamp is omitted then WolkAbout IoT Platform will assign a timestamp when it receives the alarm message.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="actuators"></a> </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Actuators</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actuators are used to enable WolkAbout IoT Platform to set the state of some part of the device, eg. flip a switch or change the gear of a motor.</p>
<p>Single actuation is consists of the command to device and feedback from a device. A command is a message that arrived at the device. Feedback is the current status of the actuator on the device which needs to be sent to the WolkAbout IoT Platform in order to complete the single actuation process. Where the current status have value and state as parameters. Value is the current value of the actuator, eg for a switch, it can be true or false. The possible actuator states are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>READY</b> - waiting to receive a command to change its value</li>
<li><b>BUSY</b> - in the process of changing its value</li>
<li><b>ERROR</b> - unable to comply</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve the actuation process a list of actuator references that are available on the device needs to be provided when connecting to WolkAbout IoT Platform in order to listen to messages containing actuation commands. The user has to implement an actuation handler that will execute the commands that have been issued from WolkAbout IoT Platform. Then the user has to implement an actuation provider that will update WolkAbout IoT platform with the current status of the actuator.**</p>
<p>Publishing of actuator statuses is performed immediately, but if the actuator takes a time to be executed, eg closing the gate, then the actuator status will update WolkAbout IoT Platform with current values until it reached the commanded value.**</p>
<p>If the device is unable to publish the actuator status then the information will be stored on the device until the next successful publish attempt.**</p>
<p>To summarise, when an actuation command is issued from WolkAbout IoT Platform, it will be passed to the actuation handler that will attempt to execute the command, and then the actuator status provider will report back to WolkAbout IoT Platform with the current value and state of the actuator.**</p>
<h2>&gt; Device Management</h2>
<p><a class="anchor" id="keep-alive-mechanism"></a> </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Keep Alive Mechanism</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In cases where the device is connected to the platform but is not publishing any data for period of 30 minutes, the device may be declared offline on the WolkAbout IoT Platform. This is especially true for devices that only have actuators for example. To prevent this issue, a keep alive mechanism will periodically send a message to WolkAbout IoT Platform. This mechanism can also be disabled to reduce bandwidth usage.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="configuration"></a> </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Configuration</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Configuration is the dynamical modification of the device properties from the WolkAbout IoT Platform with the goal to change device behavior, eg measurement heartbeat, sensors delivery reduction, enabling/disabling device interfaces, increase/decrease device logging level.</p>
<p>The configuration in a way of handling messages requires the same actions as actuation. When a configuration command is issued from WolkAbout IoT Platform, it will be passed to the configuration handler that will attempt to execute the command, and then the configuration status provider will report back to WolkAbout IoT Platform with the current values and states of the configuration parameters. With the addition that configuration parameters are always sent as a whole, even when only one value changes.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="dfu"></a> </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Device Software/Firmware Update</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>WolkAbout IoT Platform gives the possibility of updating the device software/firmware. The process is separated into three autonomous stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>delivering software/firmware file from the WolkAbout IoT Platform to a device</li>
<li>start a process of installing a file on the device</li>
<li>verify installed</li>
</ul>
<p>The device needs to be connected to and delivered current software/firmware version to the WolkAbout IoT Platform before it's starting to exploit software/firmware update.</p>
<p>The WolkAbout IoT Platform actuate the device to start a process of installing. The responsibility to successfully install file is on a device, not on WolkConnect library.</p>
<p>In order to update the firmware, the user must create a firmware handler.</p>
<p>This firmware handler will specify the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>current firmware version,</li>
<li>desired size of firmware chunk to be received from WolkAbout IoT Platform,</li>
<li>maximum supported firmware file size,</li>
<li>download location,</li>
<li>implementation of a firmware installer that will be responsible for the installation process.</li>
<li>Optionally, an implementation of firmware download handler that will download a file from an URL issued from WolkAbout IoT Platform.</li>
</ul>
